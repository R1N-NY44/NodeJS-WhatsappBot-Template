don't forget to `npm i`, then u can do `npm run whatsapp`, then ? think by ur self :v

just joke, scan the qr that appear on the console, I assume u alr have node js install on ur pc, if not just find on google cus u have internet right ?

Feel free to suggest what next feature that should be in this project, u can add it to github issue or make it by ur self âœ¨
